# Roam ShowTime

![logo](img/icon_128.png)

Browser extension to show block creation & edit times on [RoamResearch.com](https://roamresearch.com).

What it looks like:

### Instructions for use

- Toggle the time display using `C-c C-x`.
- The first time is the creation time, the second the time of last edit.
- If those are the same (ignoring seconds), only one is displayed
- For times more than 24 hours in the past, the full date is displayed.

When a lot of blocks are loaded on the page, the app will start to respond 
slowly. Toggling off the time display while you are interacting with blocks 
will then help.

[Here's how to install as a Chrome developer extension](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24577660/2611913)
when you want to install directly from this repo or from your fork of it.


### How it works

It's based on the feature described in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1265253941727465476):
> If you hit `C-c C-x` you'll get an edit icon for every block, with 
> `data-create-time` and `data-edit-time` [attributes]
> â€“ @Conaw (May 26, 2020)

This extension
- listens for DOM mutations (e.g. collapsing or editing any block);
- [throttle](https://underscorejs.org/#throttle)s these events (so that the 
  extension code does not run too often);
- on each (throttled) DOM mutation, checks whether the document contains any 
  divs with a `data-edit-time` attribute, and if so, adds absolutely positioned
  divs to the left of each bullet, with formatted time strings taken from the 
  `data-..-time` attributes.
- When the sidebar is open, some left-padding is added to both the main
  container and the sidebar, so that the timestamps fit on screen.
